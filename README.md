Google Chrome extension

Purpose: 
It is getting harder to keep track of the web sites we are giving our information like name, address, email addresses ...etc. As a result, especially by using our email addresses we are getting ad emails that we don't really want.

By the help of this extension, you can log the URLs of the web pages you entered, submitted email addresses. 

You can restrict the tracked email addresses by entering the specific email addresses using settings page.


All the process and data collected stays local to the user's computer.
